# ExcelWriter
Use Excel write to visualize your data in python and export to and excel spreadsheet

Start by importing your libraries: numpy and pandas

Read in your data into a dataframe and then write into the xslxwriter engine to export the graphics into excel

I then created different tables and charts (bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, and area chart) in python that were then exported to an excel file.

I attached the files for the imported data, exported data, and python code.
